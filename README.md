Tiny toy scraper script from 2007. (Please don't scrape...) 

Written when brushing up on Ruby and Python; the Python version is gone and I don't remember which Lisp I used - probably Steel Bank. 

The scraper could fetch the Hype Machine's What's Popular listing, or use 
search terms, follow the link, locate music files, download and store the 
MP3s to disk using reasonably sensible file names. Mostly I just wanted 
to see how many lines this would take. The Lisp version is < 30 lines of 
actual code.

Uploaded because I'm curious whether the Ruby script winds up being discoverable using Sourcegraph.
